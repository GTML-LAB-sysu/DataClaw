## Prompt

In 2022, an investment manager at a merger and acquisition fund was seeking "high R&D, low valuation" M&A targets in the textile, footwear and apparel industry, but the scope was limited to provinces covered by textile, footwear and apparel industry-related policies. The prerequisite for screening valid enterprises is: net profit amount strictly greater than zero, and both R&D investment ratio and company market cap fields have data records. On this basis, first use all valid enterprises in the industry as the benchmark population to calculate the median R&D investment ratio and the median P/E ratio respectively; then from the subset of valid enterprises located in policy-covered provinces, filter enterprises whose R&D investment ratio is higher than the industry median and whose P/E ratio is lower than the industry median. How many enterprises satisfy the above dual screening conditions? (P/E ratio = company market cap (100 million yuan) ÷ net profit amount (100 million yuan))
