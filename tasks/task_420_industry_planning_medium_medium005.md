## Prompt

In 2022, regarding the strategic choice for Guangdong Province's consumer electronics and electrical industry, a policy consulting agency proposed two competing development paths: the first is the "high-end transformation route", evaluated by the average R&D investment ratio of private enterprises, invention patent density (= total annual Chinese invention patent grants ÷ total number of enterprises), and the number of relevant industrial policies in that province; the second is the "export-oriented route", evaluated by per capita revenue (= total operating revenue ÷ total number of employees), average asset turnover rate (= mean operating revenue ÷ mean total assets), and total number of enterprises. Both routes use inter-provincial peer comparison ranking scores (score = (N - ranking) / (N - 1) × 100), with equal weight across dimensions to calculate the route total score. What is the difference between Guangdong Province's total score on the "high-end transformation route" and the "export-oriented route" (former minus latter)?

Output guidelines:
Answer format: Value (2 decimal places). A positive number indicates the high-end transformation route has a higher score, a negative number indicates the export-oriented route has a higher score. If relevant data cannot be found, please answer "No relevant data found"

Only use files under `./database/`.

## Expected Behavior

Agent should read the provided `database/` files, compute the result, and return the final answer. The final answer must follow the required output format.

## Grading Criteria

- [ ] Final answer semantically matches the gold `answer`.
- [ ] Output format follows `guidelines`.

## LLM Judge Rubric

### Criterion 1: Single-answer Correctness (Weight: 100%)

Gold answer JSON:
`4.55`

Scoring rules:
- Judge semantic equivalence between the model final answer and the gold answer.
- Return `scores` with one key `match` as 1 or 0.
- Return `total` as 1.0 if equivalent, otherwise 0.0.
