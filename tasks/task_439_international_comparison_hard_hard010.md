## Prompt

A private wealth global consumption themed account wishes to incorporate the feature of 'overseas cash flow hedging domestic cycle' for China optional consumption. For candidate companies, apply the following rules: ① Overseas Hedging Quality Score = the difference between the company's net profit margin and the median net profit margin of A-share wholesale and retail industry in 2022 + 0.5 × international market revenue share; ② If the score ≥ 15, list as core holding, with active weight = min(3.00%, Overseas Hedging Quality Score ÷ 8); otherwise, only satellite holding is permitted. Based on MINISO (MNSO) FY2022 annual report and local database, calculate and determine the most appropriate conclusion.

Output guidelines:
Answer in order: International market revenue share (%), the difference between net profit margin and the median net profit margin of A-share wholesale and retail industry (percentage points), Overseas Hedging Quality Score, and the most appropriate conclusion. Retain 2 decimal places for numerical values and return as an array. The conclusion must include position action and active weight. Example: ["26.20", "4.79", "17.89", "Core holding, active weight 2.24%"]. If relevant data cannot be found, respond with "Relevant data not found".

You may use files under `./database/` and web search.

## Expected Behavior

Agent should read the provided `database/` files, compute the result, and return the final answer. The final answer must follow the required output format.

## Grading Criteria

- [ ] Final answer semantically matches the gold `answer`.
- [ ] Output format follows `guidelines`.

## LLM Judge Rubric

### Criterion 1: Multi-answer Correctness (Weight: 100%)

Gold answer JSON:
`[26.2, 4.38, 17.48, "Core holding, active weight 2.18%"]`

Scoring rules:
- The gold answer is a list with N=4 parts.
- Judge each predicted part against the corresponding gold part by semantic equivalence.
- Return `scores` with `part_0 ... part_3` each as 0 or 1.
- Return `total = (sum(part_i)) / 4` exactly.
- If the model output is missing or cannot be parsed into 4 comparable parts, score all parts 0.
