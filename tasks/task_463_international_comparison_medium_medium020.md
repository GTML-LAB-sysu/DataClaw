## Prompt

In 2022, amid national carbon peaking and clean energy development policies, what was JinkoSolar's asset-liability ratio (total liabilities ÷ total assets × 100%) in its annual report? Compared with the median asset-liability ratios among listed companies in China's Electricity, Heat, Gas and Water Supply industry—separately for state-owned enterprises (including centrally administered SOEs, locally administered SOEs, and other SOEs) and for private enterprises—how many percentage points higher is JinkoSolar's ratio in each case?

Output guidelines:
Answer in order: JinkoSolar's asset-liability ratio (%); percentage points above the state-owned median; percentage points above the private enterprise median. Use 2 decimal places; return as an array. If relevant data cannot be found, answer "No relevant data found".

You may use files under `./database/` and web search.

## Expected Behavior

Agent should read the provided `database/` files, compute the result, and return the final answer. The final answer must follow the required output format.

## Grading Criteria

- [ ] Final answer semantically matches the gold `answer`.
- [ ] Output format follows `guidelines`.

## LLM Judge Rubric

### Criterion 1: Multi-answer Correctness (Weight: 100%)

Gold answer JSON:
`[75.15, 13.88, 22.57]`

Scoring rules:
- The gold answer is a list with N=3 parts.
- Judge each predicted part against the corresponding gold part by semantic equivalence.
- Return `scores` with `part_0 ... part_2` each as 0 or 1.
- Return `total = (sum(part_i)) / 3` exactly.
- If the model output is missing or cannot be parsed into 3 comparable parts, score all parts 0.
