## Prompt

In 2022, against the backdrop of intensive policy rollouts for the new energy vehicle industry, what was the proportion of R&D personnel to total employees in NIO's annual report? By how many percentage points did it differ from the median R&D personnel ratio among private enterprises and state-owned enterprises (including central and local state-owned enterprises) in China's automobile manufacturing industry?

Output guidelines:
Answer in order: NIO's R&D personnel ratio (%), the number of percentage points above the private enterprise median, and the number of percentage points above the state-owned enterprise median. Retain 2 decimal places for values. E.g. [37.46, 24.19, 22.02]. If the relevant data cannot be found, answer "Relevant data not found"

You may use files under `./database/` and web search.

## Expected Behavior

Agent should read the provided `database/` files, compute the result, and return the final answer. The final answer must follow the required output format.

## Grading Criteria

- [ ] Final answer semantically matches the gold `answer`.
- [ ] Output format follows `guidelines`.

## LLM Judge Rubric

### Criterion 1: Multi-answer Correctness (Weight: 100%)

Gold answer JSON:
`[37.46, 24.19, 22.02]`

Scoring rules:
- The gold answer is a list with N=3 parts.
- Judge each predicted part against the corresponding gold part by semantic equivalence.
- Return `scores` with `part_0 ... part_2` each as 0 or 1.
- Return `total = (sum(part_i)) / 3` exactly.
- If the model output is missing or cannot be parsed into 3 comparable parts, score all parts 0.
