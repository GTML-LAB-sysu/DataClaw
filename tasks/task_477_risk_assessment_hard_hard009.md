## Prompt

In 2022, build a comprehensive industry-level risk resilience scoring system covering all manufacturing industries with total enterprises not less than 25 (excluding Finance, Real Estate, and Conglomerate industries). The scoring framework has three dimensions with different weights: Asset Return Efficiency (weight 40%), measured as the industry's average operating profit per enterprise divided by average total assets per enterprise; R&D Investment Intensity (weight 30%), measured as the industry's average R&D investment per enterprise divided by average operating revenue per enterprise; and Financial Desensitization to Policy Subsidies (weight 30%), measured as the industry's total operating profit divided by (total government subsidies + 1)—adding 1 to the denominator avoids division by zero when subsidies are zero. Each of the three raw indicators is min-max normalized across industries, scaled to a 0–100 score, then weighted by the above weights to yield the final score. Under this system, what is the comprehensive score of the top-ranked industry?

Output guidelines:
Answer format: numeric value (2 decimal places). If relevant data cannot be found, please answer "No relevant data found"

Only use files under `./database/`.

## Expected Behavior

Agent should read the provided `database/` files, compute the result, and return the final answer. The final answer must follow the required output format.

## Grading Criteria

- [ ] Final answer semantically matches the gold `answer`.
- [ ] Output format follows `guidelines`.

## LLM Judge Rubric

### Criterion 1: Single-answer Correctness (Weight: 100%)

Gold answer JSON:
`65.11`

Scoring rules:
- Judge semantic equivalence between the model final answer and the gold answer.
- Return `scores` with one key `match` as 1 or 0.
- Return `total` as 1.0 if equivalent, otherwise 0.0.
